I realized recently that I have a lot of collections of
things and now real way to effectively track them in one
place. So I set out to do something about it. This is going
to be a website using Java's Spring Boot to create a full
REST api in tandem with Angular to create a fully reactive
frontend in order to make listing and archiving your
collections a quick and comfortable experience
